Hi, there!! Happy new year!


At the start of each year we decide few things that we want to achieve in that year. But, me mostly fail to do some of things, mainly because we don't write down what we wan to do(at least this is true for me).

So, I thought I should write down the things I want to do definitely do in this year. This post serves as a medium to do that.


## Vision 2020:

- Learn Reinforcement Learning
- Start contributing on GitHub
- Code at least for an hour every day
- Read at least one research paper per week

- Read books:

  - [ ] I, robot
  - [ ] Frankenstein
  - [ ] Why do we sleep?
