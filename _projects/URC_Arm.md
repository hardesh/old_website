I am a member of the robot arm subsystem in Project Kratos. We are aiming to participate in the University Rover Challenge, 2020 in Utah.
I am presently working on the control system of the arm. I have also helped in designing the arm.  
I have also worked in the drive system of the rover.

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/hardesh/urc_arm).
