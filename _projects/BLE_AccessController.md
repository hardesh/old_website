I worked on this project during my summer internship at [Smart-i Electronics Systems](http://www.smartisystems.com/), Pune. Project Mentor: [Siddesh Madiwale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddesh-madiwale-67620315/)


Here are some highlights of the project:

- Implementation an AES based protocol for secure data transmission. 
- Also used wiegand protocol, for trasmitting the card no.
