Hello!!

I'm undergraduate student from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Goa Campus majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering with minor in Physics. 

I'm currently interested in Robotics, particularly aerial robotics. I am also interested in the role of embedded systems in our day-to-day life. 

I'm looking for Undergraduate Thesis/RA opportunities in the field of Robotics.
