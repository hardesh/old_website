Hello!!

I'm undergraduate student from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Goa Campus majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering with minor in Physics. 

I'm currently interested in Robotics, particularly aerial robotics. I am also interested in the role of embedded systems in our day-to-day life. I like to learn new stuff and to explore new things

Apart from my technical interests, I also like to take [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/harshulk254/). I like to read about astronomy & astrophysics and I am into PC gaming.

I'm looking for Undergraduate Thesis/RA opportunities in the field of Robotics from summer 2020.
